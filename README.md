The sticky Nav Bar is built using HTML CSS and Javascript. The Nav bar will always be on display which allows the user easy access at all times on the webpage 
Furthermore, when a item on the nav bar is clicked, javscript will be excuted which will scroll the webpage smootly to the desired section. 
CSS was used to stylize the 'button' to fit in within the theme.

The main content of the page is made using css flexbox. This allowed for the content to be evenly distrbuited and to keep it asethitcally pleasing. 

The webpage uses icons as hyperlinks that can be easily modified by a web developer to implement their own hyperlinks.
